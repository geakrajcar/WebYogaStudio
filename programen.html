		<h1>Integral Vinyasa Flow Yoga</h1>
		<p class="lead"> The Integral Vinyasa Flow Yoga classes we teach at our center are, as the name itself says, integral, complete. Each class
		consists of an initial visualization and relaxation, Pranayama (breathing exercises), followed by a progressive sequence of asanas, with a
		special emphasis on biomechanics and physical and subtle anatomy of the body. We move through asanas progressively, gradually opening the
		body and preparing it for deeper entry into a physical, then more subtle, practice. We often use mudras and mantras, closing the whole
		practice with relaxation and meditation. Taking into account the natural cycles of ourselves and nature, classes have different themes,
		intensity, rhythm and intent. In this way, breath by breath, and asana by asana we come closer to meditation in movement and natural
		harmony inside and around us. The Integral Vinyasa System was created by Nina Vukas. This dynamic and extremely fluent style of yoga has
		its roots in Prana Vinyasa (Shiva Rea) and Ashtanga Vinyasa method.

				<h2>ABC Yoga</h2>
				<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i>

				<p> ABC Yoga classes (Absolute Beginners Classes) are a great intro to any dynamic yoga styles (like Ashtanga Vinyasa or Vinyasa Flow).
				These classes are designed for absolute beginners who didn't get in touch with yoga before, but also for those who have practiced some other styles
				of yoga and would like to get a taste of Vinyasa Flow. You will learn all the basics here, such as
				yogic Ujjayi breath, some other simple Pranayamas and how to use the bandhas (energy locks). We will practice in detail the Sun salutations and learn about some
				basic asanas (yoga postures), everything with a slow pace. It will open up the chance to become aware of your breath,
				to learn how to synchronize the breath with the movement and embody the dynamic transitions between the asanas. Still, we will spend enough time
				holding the positions so you can feel the alignment of the body. Beside the active part of the practice, there is always enough time to sit in
				silence and practice guided relaxation and meditation.

				<h2> Easy Flow</h2>
				<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				<p> Easy Flow yoga is a gentler Integral Vinyasa class. This class is suitable for advanced beginners, or those who prefer a
				medium to a more intense practice. After we adopt the basics of ABC Yoga, the Easy Flow transitions between yoga positions become
				softer, more conscious and fluid, and we begin to embody meditation in movement. We  move towards more demanding positions while
				we are entering deeper into our yoga practice. The beauty of Integral Vinyasa Yoga lies in a progressive approach, as well as in
				the modifications and position variations through which everybody has the opportunity to embody their safe and convenient expression
				of practice. Through guided sequences we try to find and explore moments and space within our body for creating lightness of movement
				while using breath as our primary guide. A mandatory of the practice is devoted to the breath and Pranayama, and it begins and
				ends with relaxation and meditation. These classes are thematic, so we create the practice following elements (Earth, Water, Fire,
				Air), doshas, chakras or a certain asana group (balance, spine rotation, forward bending, spine extension, hips rotation). </p>

				<p> Vinyasa Flow classes are intended primarily for advanced yogis who have a regular yoga practice. Following the structure of
				Integral Vinyasa Flow Yoga, we are moving  progressively towards more demanding, more advanced asanas. The intense sequence of
				each asana allows us entry deeper into our own practice through progressive approach and gradual preparation of the body. By moving
				towards challenging asanas we learn to remain present, with a calm breath and a soft body. Despite the demanding practice, emphasis
				is placed on a multitude of variations and modifications of positions so that everybody can at any given time find their pleasant
				asana, respecting their body and mind. These classes are thematic, so we create the practice following elements (Earth, Water, Fire,
				Air), doshas, chakras or a certain asana group (balance, spine rotation, forward bending, spine extension, hips rotation). </p>

				<p> Prenatal yoga is designed to support the future mother at all stages of pregnancy and through all changes occurring on a physical, mental,
				and emotional level. The class consists of exercises of breathing, visualization and meditation, and a fluid sequence of gentle
				positions with a guided relaxation at the end. We work on relaxing painful parts of the body, mind and breath calming, gentle
				stretching, while raising awareness of our inner strength and relaxing deeply. Sequences designed specifically for pregnant women
				will give you a quieter sleep and mind, a painless back, they will promote circulation, prevent water retention in the body,
				and improve your digestion. Yoga techniques of breathing and guided meditation will prepare you for an active birth. During the
				class, we create space and time where future mothers can connect with themselves and with their inner strength while focusing
				their attention towards themselves and their breath. You can start practicing Prenatal Yoga after your 12th week of pregnancy.
				Please notify your doctor about your practice in order to get consent. Check out why our future mommies don’t miss any class. :)</p>

				<p> Yin Yoga is a revitalizing yoga style in which we work on deep connective tissue and fascia through full indulgence and
				long retention of passive positions. Unlike the dynamic practice that is most common in our schedule, in this practice you
				will be invited to completely immerse in positions, to blend your body and muscles, and to, in a slightly different way from
				which you are used to, deepen your dive into your practice. Such an approach will give you an opportunity to devote to your
				breath more, as well as an opportunity to face yourself and emotions that can come to the surface. You can expect deep relaxation
				from this practice. Also, at Yin Yoga classes, we dedicate even more time to Pranayama and guided relaxation than the other
				classes. </p>

				<p> Chinese Yoga classes are focused on therapeutic work, maintaining a healthy spine and/or restoring the function of all
				muscles that support the proper functioning of the spine. Classes are tailored to all participants in the center, especially those
				who suffer from some injury or suffer from consequences of an injury. We focus on reeducation and strengthening of the muscles
				along the spine and abdominal, releasing tension and pain. This yoga class is essentially Chinese Yoga of five elements
				in which we work through the elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) while using different dynamics and strength and exploring
				the qualities of each element. We move the body through various breathing rhythms while practicing different qualities of each
				element. </p>
